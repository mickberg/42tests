# 42tests
Tests for different projects I'm doing in Hive.

The idea for this repo is to have a single repo for all tests for different projects I'm doing at Hive.
By having them in one repo I can include this repo as a submodule in any project and call the proper tests within the project,
eliminiting the need to switch branches or repos for testing.
